# Agentic Coding Framework — Refinement Checklist

**Tool-Agnostic · Filtered by Token / Quality / Autonomy Dimensions**

This document contains refinement suggestions for the framework itself, independent of any specific tool or orchestrator. These apply to any AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.) adopting this framework.

---

## Filtering Criteria

From four comparative analyses (BDD / SDD / TDD / DDD) yielding 30 suggestions, filtered by three dimensions:

| Dimension | Guiding Question |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Token** | Does it save tokens in actual agent workflows? (Prevent reruns, reduce ambiguity, avoid scope bloat) |
| **Quality** | Does it measurably improve agent output quality? |
| **Autonomy** | Does it make agents more self-directed, reducing human intervention? |

All three dimensions → Must-Do, two → Worth-Doing, one or fewer → Not Included.

## Not Included (17 Items) and Rationale

| Original Suggestion | Reason for Exclusion |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Background Syntax Standardization | Cosmetic formatting; agents can parse existing syntax |
| @wip / @skip Tags | `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` already covers the core need |
| Example Mapping | Human process, not an agent process |
| Module Error Handling Strategy | Project-level detail; framework should not prescribe |
| ADR Status Mechanism | Human process management; agents only need "what is the current decision" |
| Event Storming Integration | Human process; framework is positioned as the agent's working foundation |
| Context Mapping Patterns (supplement) | Only needed for enterprise-scale scenarios; add when encountered |
| ~~Dynamic Context Loading~~ | ~~Implementation-layer concern~~ → **Incorporated** into Protocol v0.4 Multi-Executor Scoped Context Loading |
| ~~Test/Impl Context Isolation~~ | ~~Implementation-layer concern~~ → **Incorporated** into Protocol v0.4 Multi-Executor Role-Based Context Isolation |
| Aggregate Design Principles | Only triggered at Level 3; too early to define |
| Context Evolution Strategy | Very few projects encounter this |
| Runtime View | BDD scenarios already describe behavior |
| Cross-cutting Concerns | Can be folded into Constitution |
| Deployment View | Framework intentionally excludes; stops at image push |
| ~~Agent Subscription Mechanism~~ | ~~Multi-agent collaboration implementation-layer~~ → **Incorporated** into Protocol v0.4 Multi-Executor Coordinator ↔ Executor Communication |
| ~~YAML Handoff Format~~ | ~~Multi-agent collaboration implementation-layer~~ → **Incorporated** into Protocol v0.4 Multi-Executor Per-Task HANDOFF + Protocol v0.5 HANDOFF.md Hybrid Format (YAML front matter) |
| Multi-Language Test Scaffolding | Extend as needed; no need to predefine |

## Field Feedback — WebRTC Project (FB-001~006)

Source: `go-webrtc/.ai/feedback.md` — Field observations after completing US-001 Room Isolation.

### FB-R01: Full/Lite Mode ← FB-004

**Decision: User specifies the mode in CLAUDE.md. Agent does not auto-detect.**

Configuration: Add `Agentic Coding Mode: full` or `lite` in CLAUDE.md's Agent Guidelines section.

**Lite mode also retains a minimal PROJECT_MEMORY (NOW + NEXT only, ~5 lines).** Rationale: even tasks assumed to be one-time may have follow-up sessions. The cost is negligible (~50 input tokens/turn) and provides a breakpoint for future sessions. This also makes Lite → Full upgrades smoother — NOW/NEXT already exist as a foundation.

| | Full Mode | Lite Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Use case | Multi-session handoff, high coupling, multi-agent | Urgent start, low coupling, short tasks |
| CLAUDE.md | Complete | ≤10 lines |
| PROJECT_MEMORY | Complete (NOW/NEXT/TESTS/SYNC/ISSUES) | Minimal (NOW + NEXT only, ~5 lines) |
| SDD / Constitution / NFR | Yes | Skip |
| Delta Spec | Yes | Verbal or commit message |
| BDD | Full Gherkin | Write tests directly |
| HANDOFF | Yes | Not used |

**Lite mode positioning — an on-ramp to Full:**

Lite mode is not just "for small tasks." It also serves as an entry point for projects that will eventually need Full mode but can't afford the Bootstrap cost right now.

| Scenario | Mode | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| New project, 5+ stories planned | Full | Worth the upfront investment |
| Existing project, full framework adoption | Full | Bootstrap once, amortize over time |
| Existing project, urgent need to start NOW | Lite → upgrade to Full later | Ship first, build infrastructure later |
| Full project winding down, only small fixes left | Full → downgrade to Lite | Infrastructure overhead no longer justified |
| One-off bug fix or small feature | Lite | Will never need upgrade |

**Mode switching:**

Users can switch modes in two equivalent ways:
1. Directly edit the mode line in CLAUDE.md
2. Tell the agent verbally (e.g., "switch to Full mode") — agent updates CLAUDE.md

**Agent behavior on mode switch — must acknowledge and inform:**

When the agent detects a mode change (either by reading CLAUDE.md or receiving a verbal instruction), it MUST:
1. Confirm the switch direction (Lite → Full or Full → Lite)
2. Explain which scenario this matches from the table above, and why this mode fits
3. Execute the corresponding transition

Example: User says "switch to Full mode" →
> "Switching to Full mode. This is typically for projects needing multi-session handoff or where stories have high coupling. I'll run the Upgrade Checklist to set up the missing infrastructure..."

**Upgrade Checklist (Lite → Full):**
```
1. ☐ Expand CLAUDE.md (add Why/Who/What, Project Structure, Development Conventions)
2. ☐ Expand PROJECT_MEMORY.md (add TESTS/SYNC/ISSUES to existing NOW/NEXT)
3. ☐ Create docs/sdd/sdd.md (scan codebase, reverse-engineer)
4. ☐ Create docs/constitution.md (3-5 core principles)
5. ☐ Create .ai/HANDOFF.md + .ai/history.md
6. ☐ Human confirms above outputs
```

**Downgrade (Full → Lite):**
- Update CLAUDE.md mode line
- Agent stops maintaining SDD/HANDOFF/full Memory
- Existing docs remain (not deleted), just no longer actively maintained
- Slim PROJECT_MEMORY to NOW + NEXT only

**Design rationale:**
- Agent auto-detection is unreliable (story count ≠ complexity)
- The real decision axes are "handoff frequency × change coupling", which require human context
- CLAUDE.md exists in both modes, making it the most natural location for this setting
- Persists across sessions without needing to be re-stated verbally
- Mode switching via verbal instruction is natural and equivalent to manual CLAUDE.md edit

**Status:** 🟡 Finalized, pending incorporation into Framework + Skill

### FB-R02: Token Cost Optimization ← FB-001 + FB-003

**Decision: Two-layer approach — slim down auto-resent files + HANDOFF as latest-entry-only.**

**Layer 1: Input tokens — PROJECT_MEMORY slim-down**

Design principle: Files auto-resent by system-reminder = files you pay for every turn. Only keep information the agent needs every turn.

| Section | Keep/Move | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| NOW | Keep | Needed every turn |
| NEXT | Keep | Scope guard + priority |
| TESTS | Keep | Quick quality status check |
| SYNC | Keep | Orientation / locator |
| ISSUES | Keep | Scope guard reference (FB-002: saw hardcoded IP → checked TD-03 → belongs to US-002 → don't touch) |
| DONE | Move → `.ai/history.md` | Only useful at session start, not needed every turn |
| LOG | Move → `.ai/history.md` | git log is always available, not needed every turn |

Estimated effect: PROJECT_MEMORY ~55 lines → ~35 lines, saving ~200 input tokens per turn.

**Layer 2: Output tokens — HANDOFF latest-entry-only + history archive**

- HANDOFF.md is latest-entry-only: each session overwrites it with current state
- Historical session records are appended to `.ai/history.md` (shared with DONE/LOG)
- Agent only needs to read HANDOFF (one entry) at session start; reads history only when needed

Effect: HANDOFF write volume is fixed and small (one block), no more full-file rewrites.

**Impact on Skill files:**
1. workflow.md — Update Memory step: DONE and LOG write to `.ai/history.md`
2. templates.md — PROJECT_MEMORY template slimmed down, DONE and LOG removed, new location noted
3. SKILL.md — New principle: "Keep auto-resent files minimal"
4. workflow.md — HANDOFF section changed to latest-entry-only + history archive

**Status:** 🟡 Finalized, pending Skill incorporation

### FB-R03: Bootstrap Strategy ← FB-005 + FB-006

**Decision: Characterization tests moved from Bootstrap checklist to per-Story Step 0 pre-check. "Touch it, test it" strategy.**

**Scope Rule: Only test the current behavior of functions this Story will modify. Don't test the entire module.**

Example: US-002 modifies `setupPeerConnection` → only add characterization tests for `setupPeerConnection`, not for `closePeerConnection` in the same module that nobody is changing.

**Step 0: Safety Net Check (Full Mode only, existing codebases only)**
```
- List the functions/modules this Story will modify
- Check if each has existing test coverage
- If no coverage → add characterization test (current behavior only)
- If covered → proceed
```

Lite Mode does not distinguish characterization vs new tests — write tests directly.

**Design rationale:**
- Writing all characterization tests at once is too expensive (entire session with zero feature output)
- May write tests for modules that will never be modified — waste
- Just-in-time testing: only spend cost when protection is needed
- Cost is naturally amortized across Stories, no single session is all-testing

**Impact on Skill files:**
1. workflow.md — Bootstrap section: remove "write characterization tests for all existing features"
2. workflow.md — Add Step 0: Safety Net Check before Per-Story Steps
3. SKILL.md — New principle: "Touch it, test it"

**Status:** 🟡 Finalized, pending Skill incorporation

### FB-R04: PROJECT_MEMORY + HANDOFF Value Assessment ← FB-002

**Observation recorded, no independent action needed.** Conclusion merged into FB-R01 (Full/Lite mode applicability).

Cross-session projects benefit from Memory/HANDOFF. Single-session tasks do not. This is exactly why Lite Mode exists.

**Status:** ✅ Merged into FB-R01
